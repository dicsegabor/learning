# Hexxagon 

It was my third university project.
It is a homemade version of the game called Hexxaggon.

It has an object oriented approach, as everything in java.

I just wanted to make a better version of my first project,
but the use of javafx was really hard that time, and turned out not so good.
I still loved it, and it was a little bit more planned than the first.
