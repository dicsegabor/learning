# Hexxaggon_C
My first university project.
It is made with the beautiful language of C.

It is a "homemade" version of the, I think popular game: Hexxaggon.
Certainly I loved it, but thats not the point.

It was my first project, and I enjoyed every bit of it.
With the help of Sdl2, I was able to kind of replicate the original game, altough it works differently of course.

The best part was the AI. It was the reason I chose this, because I alwyas wondered how they worked.
